# RMarkdown & Friends

The main document holding all slides/notes is *rmarkdown_friends_workshop.Rmd*, of which *rmarkdown_friends_workshop.html* is a rendered version.

The best way to view the slides is to clone this repository (big green button at the top right) and open the Rproj-file in RStudio.

You can also simply copy the HTML file and open it in your browser.

The Friends in the title refers to [posterdown](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown/wiki), [bookdown](bookdown.org/) and [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown).
I have also included some simple example files of each.

For any questions, feel free to open an issue in this repository or contact me on twitter @adfi.
